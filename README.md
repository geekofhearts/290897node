GENODE - Genetic Programing in Node.js
===

not so much with a plan yet, mostly just some methods for evaling and fitness-testing a bunch of functions-as-strings.

also working on random code generation, and eventually will obviously need mutation / breeding.

test function will be sqrt(x), although will need a more complex one later to test the arbitrary numbers of arguments etc.
