29 08 97 node - Genetic Programing in Node.js
===

_first called genode, which is [something else](http://genode.org/), and because [skynode was taken too](http://www.satwest.com/SkyNode_Tracker_p/sdt-200.htm) I went with "29th of August 1997 (in) Node"_

not so much with a plan yet, mostly just some methods for evaling and fitness-testing a bunch of functions-as-strings.

also working on random code generation, and eventually will obviously need mutation / breeding.

test function will be sqrt(x), although will need a more complex one later to test the arbitrary numbers of arguments etc.
